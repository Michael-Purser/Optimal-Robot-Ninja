# Optimal robot ninja

This repository contains the matlab and python code written for the master thesis 'Optimal robot ninja: making robots move in an optimal and responsive way'.
The goal of this thesis is to make a mobile robot platform move optimally in an environment containing static (optionally also dynamic) obstacles. Optimality is defined her with respect to time.
The project is a collaboration between Intermodalics and the MECO research group at the KU Leuven.

## Structure of this repo
The repository contains following folders:
 - __/matlab__: matlab code and simulation environment.
 - __/python__: python implementation of matlab code, with an architecture that fits the ROS environment used at Intermodalics, more specifically the move-base-flex package.
 - __/c++__: C++ implementation of the code

Below is a figure of the code architecture:

## Robot platform
The mobile platform used to implement the code is a [Turtlebot 2](http://www.willowgarage.com/turtlebot), used together with a custom vision system developed at Intermodalics.  
Platform characteristics ([full datasheet](http://bit.ly/1L2FIzG)):
 - diameter: 354 mm, height: 420 mm
 - weight: 6,3 kg (bottom-heavy, max payload: 5 kg)
 - max speed: 0,65 m/s
 - max rotational speed: 180Â°/s
 - vision system: depth measurements with dual camera
 - noise on measurements: few cm
 - costmap availability frequency: 5 Hz
 - position estimate availability frequency: 20 to 25 Hz
 - positioning accuracy: few cm
