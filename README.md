# Optimal robot ninja

This repository contains the matlab and python code written for the master thesis 'Optimal robot ninja: making robots move in an optimal and responsive way'.
The goal of this thesis is to make a mobile robot platform move optimally in an environment containing static (optionally also dynamic) obstacles. Optimality is defined her with respect to time.
The project is a collaboration between Intermodalics and the MECO research group at the KU Leuven.

## Structure of this repo
The repository contains following folders:
 - __/matlab__: matlab code and simulation environment.
 - __/python__: python implementation of matlab code, with an architecture that fits the ROS environment used at Intermodalics, more specifically the move-base-flex package.
 - __/c++__: C++ implementation of the code

The current state of the code architecture can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ik6OIk-_bxGukOGU0d6ETbQlOADYXYE9).

## Robot platform
The mobile platform used for implementation is a [Turtlebot 2](http://www.willowgarage.com/turtlebot), together with a custom vision system developed at Intermodalics.  
Platform characteristics (full datasheet available [here](http://bit.ly/1L2FIzG)):
 - diameter: 354 mm, height: 420 mm
 - weight: 6,3 kg (bottom-heavy), max payload: 5 kg
 - max speed: 0,65 m/s, max rotational speed: 180Â°/s
 - vision system: depth measurement (dual camera)
 - noise on measurements: ~ 3 cm
 - costmap availability frequency: 5 Hz
 - localization availability frequency: 20 to 25 Hz
 - localization accuracy: a few cm
