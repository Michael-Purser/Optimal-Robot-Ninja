# Optimal Robot Ninja: work progress

For the last two months of the thesis, I have to decided to keep an online log of performed **C++ implementation** work.  
For the sake of clarity, this log will not be by date - rather, as can be seen below, it splits the work into the 'completed', the 'in progress' and the 'to do' category.

## Completed
First, I had to get to grips with the ROS/gazebo/rviz interface and workflow; I therefore figured how to de the following things:
 * Get the [turtlebot tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation) working in Gazebo on ROS kinetic, and steer the turtlebot around using keyboard teleop.
 * Visualise turtlebot info using rviz (following the [turtlebot rviz tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/3D%20Visualisation)).
 * Reviewed (yet again) ROS concepts, and listened to some of the topics of the above gazebo turtlebot simulation with a simple 'rostopic echo' command.
 *
