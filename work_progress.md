# Optimal Robot Ninja: work progress

For the last two months of the thesis, I have to decided to keep an online log of performed **C++ implementation** work.  
For the sake of clarity, this log will not be by date - rather, as can be seen below, it splits the work into the 'completed', the 'in progress' and the 'to do' category.

## Completed
 * Got [turtlebot tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation) working in Gazebo on ROS kinetic, including keyboard teleop.
 * Visualised turtlebot info using the [turtlebot rviz tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/3D%20Visualisation).
